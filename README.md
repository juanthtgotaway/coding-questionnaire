## Description 
This project was made for us to push ourselves and see how we could apply what we have learned so far. Although this was a great challenge to implement our skills it was very challenging to say the least. This project really encompassed all the HTML, CSS, and JS skill we have learned. Every project I learn more and more regarding the concepts we have learned. I will touch on a few of the things I learned: 
<br>

**In HTML:** the importance to learn to use the inspect tool. When I was trying to apply styles to the high scores tab for some reason that specific class would not allow me to position it nor apply spacing to the sides. Using the inspect tool I kept trying to figure out how to manually apply styles so it would recognize it if for some reason the style wouldnt apply to from the css. This came in handy once more as the same happed later on when I tried to apply styles to the time class. 
<br>

**In CSS:** the biggest key take away is the way you name an ID in JS is exactly how you have to spell it in CSS. Same capital letters or else the styles will NOT APPLY. CSS in this project wasnt as big but the root variable was enjoyable to use as it allowed me to experiment with different color combinations until I found one I liked and it allowed me to change all the styles much faster than having to independently go in and change the colors.

**In JS:** this challenge most definitely pushed me the hardest. As it was very demanding on the funtions. The biggest resource was the mini assignment as it allowed me to kinda know where to begin. Start on the start event listener and work my way back and trace the equations back to see what we needed to solve for. A small thing I noticed is the importance of the """" tags. I use them for anything text related as it lets me see what is physical text in my JS vs something that is being refrenced. At first I was using """" for everything and this would not allow certain functions to execute properly. There were 2 big frustrations along the way that I was able to look into and see why things werent working. The first was the fact that my "incorrect" or "correct" text wasnt working. I later realized it was due to the page loading to fast and I had to add a timeout function to allow the funtion to execute then allow the other part to execute after the text is displayed. The second part was  that the showhighscores still displayed after the user submted their initials. This function took forever to figure out but it was a simple fix to tell it to not display (display = 'none')
